## Instructions

Pong is a two player game.  The goal is to strike the opposite wall with the ball, preventing the ball from striking your wall using your paddle.  The left paddle is controlled using the "W" and "S" keys, and the right paddle is controlled by the "Up arrow" and "Down arrow" keys.  The game will end when someone scores 3 points.
